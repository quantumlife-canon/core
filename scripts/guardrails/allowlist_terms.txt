# Allowlist for forbidden terms
#
# Add file paths here to exempt them from forbidden terms check.
# One path per line, relative to repo root.
# Supports glob patterns.
#
# Example:
#   internal/legacy/user_migration.go
#   pkg/compat/*.go
#
# WARNING: Adding entries here weakens Canon enforcement.
# Each exception should be justified and temporary.
#

# External OAuth API integrations (v5)
# These files interface with Google/Microsoft APIs which use external terminology.
# The terms are in URL literals or external API documentation comments.
# QuantumLife core still uses "circle" - these are data plane adapters only.
