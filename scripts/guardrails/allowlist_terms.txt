# Add file paths here to exempt them from forbidden terms check.
# One path per line, relative to repo root.
# Supports glob patterns.

# WARNING: Adding entries here weakens Canon enforcement.
# Each exception should be justified and temporary.

# External OAuth API integrations (v5)
# These files interface with Google/Microsoft APIs which use external terminology.
# The terms are in URL literals or external API documentation comments.
# QuantumLife core still uses "circle" - these are data plane adapters only.

# Financial Read (v8)
# These files handle financial data where "account" means "bank account" or
# "financial account", NOT "user account". The financial domain requires this
# terminology to match banking/payment industry standards and provider APIs.
# QuantumLife core still uses "circle" for identity - these are data plane adapters.
