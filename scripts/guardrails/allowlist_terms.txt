# Add file paths here to exempt them from forbidden terms check.
# One path per line, relative to repo root.
# Supports glob patterns.

# Example:
#   internal/legacy/user_migration.go
#   pkg/compat/*.go

# WARNING: Adding entries here weakens Canon enforcement.
# Each exception should be justified and temporary.
