## Purpose

This document translates the constitutional principles of v9 execution into plain-language guarantees. Every guarantee here is a promise from the system to you. These are not aspirations—they are requirements that the system MUST fulfill.

If the system violates any guarantee in this document, that violation is a defect, regardless of intent or outcome.

---

## 1. Execution Consent Guarantees

### 1.1 No Execution Without Your Explicit Approval

QuantumLife will NEVER move your money, make a payment, or create a financial commitment without your explicit approval. "Explicit" means you took a clear action to approve—not that you failed to object, not that you seemed to want it, not that it would have been convenient.

**What this means for you**: If you did not clearly say "yes" to a specific action, that action will not happen.

### 1.2 Approval Is Specific

When you approve an execution, you approve exactly that execution—not a category of executions, not "things like this," not "whatever seems right." Your approval applies to a specific action with a specific amount, recipient, and timing.

**What this means for you**: Approving one payment does not approve future payments. Each execution stands alone unless you explicitly create a recurring authority.

### 1.3 Approval Is Time-Bound

Every approval you give has an expiration. If you approve an action and time passes without execution, the approval expires. You will need to approve again. There is no permanent approval.

**What this means for you**: An approval you gave months ago cannot surprise you with execution today.

### 1.4 Approval Artifacts Are Inspectable

Every approval you give is recorded in a form you can inspect. You can see exactly what you approved, when you approved it, and what scope and limits you set. These records are yours.

**What this means for you**: You can always answer the question "what did I authorize?" by looking at your approval history.

---

## 2. Caps and Limits Guarantees

### 2.1 Hard Caps on Amount

You set the maximum amount any execution can involve. This cap is absolute. The system will NEVER execute an action that exceeds your cap, even if you request it in the moment. Changing the cap requires a separate, deliberate action.

**What this means for you**: If you set a $500 cap, no single execution will ever exceed $500—even if you accidentally try to approve more.

### 2.2 Hard Caps on Frequency

You set how often execution can occur. If you authorize a weekly payment, it cannot happen daily. Frequency caps prevent execution from accelerating beyond what you intended.

**What this means for you**: Execution cannot speed up without you explicitly changing the frequency limit.

### 2.3 Hard Caps on Duration

You set how long any authority lasts. When the duration ends, the authority ends. No authority is permanent. No authority auto-renews.

**What this means for you**: Authorizations you create do not live forever. They expire, and you must consciously renew them.

### 2.4 Caps Are Human-Defined

You define your caps. The system does not suggest caps, does not adjust caps, does not recommend cap changes. Your caps are yours.

**What this means for you**: The system will never say "we increased your limit because you seemed to need more."

### 2.5 Caps Cannot Be Auto-Adjusted

No algorithm, pattern, or inference will ever modify your caps. If your cap is $100, it remains $100 until you change it. Usage patterns do not change caps. Machine learning does not change caps. Only you change caps.

**What this means for you**: Your limits are exactly where you set them, always.

## 3. Revocation Guarantees

### 3.1 Revocation Halts Execution Immediately

If you revoke an approval or authority, execution stops. Not "after this batch." Not "once the current action completes." Immediately. Revocation is an emergency brake, and emergency brakes work instantly.

**What this means for you**: When you say stop, it stops.

### 3.2 No "Finish What You Started"

The system will NEVER argue that it should complete an action you've revoked because stopping would be inconvenient, costly, or complicated. Your revocation is absolute. Consequences of stopping are secondary to your authority to stop.

**What this means for you**: You are never trapped in an execution you no longer want.

### 3.3 Partial Execution Surfaces Clearly

If revocation stops an execution midway, you will see exactly what happened and what did not. Partial outcomes are never hidden. You will know the state of things.

**What this means for you**: If you stop a multi-step action, you'll see precisely which steps completed and which did not.

### 3.4 Revocation Is Always Available

The ability to revoke is never hidden, disabled, or made difficult. Revocation is a primary action, not a buried setting. You can always find the stop button.

**What this means for you**: You don't have to hunt for the way to cancel.

## 4. Multi-Party Guarantees

### 4.1 Shared Money Requires Shared Approval

If an execution involves money that belongs to multiple people (a shared account, family funds, intersection resources), everyone whose money is affected MUST approve. One person cannot spend another person's money without their explicit consent.

**What this means for you**: Your money in a shared context cannot be spent without your approval.

### 4.2 Identical Information for All Approvers

When multiple people must approve an execution, every approver sees exactly the same information. No approver sees a different framing, different numbers, or different context. Symmetry is mandatory.

**What this means for you**: You see what others see. There is no "version for you" and "version for them."

### 4.3 No Asymmetric Persuasion

The system will NEVER present an execution differently to different approvers in hopes of obtaining approval. There is no persuasion layer. There is no "how do we get them to say yes." All parties see neutral, identical information.

**What this means for you**: No one is being manipulated into approving something you're not being manipulated into approving.

### 4.4 Approval Thresholds Are Explicit

In multi-party contexts, you will always know: How many approvals are required? Who has approved? Who has not? What happens if someone declines? These rules are visible, not hidden.

**What this means for you**: You understand the rules of multi-party approval before you participate.

## 5. Explainability Guarantees

### 5.1 Every Execution Answers: What Happened

After any execution, you can see exactly what occurred. What money moved? Where did it go? What commitment was made? This information is never vague.

**What this means for you**: You will never wonder "what did the system actually do?"

### 5.2 Every Execution Answers: Why

Every execution links back to the reason it occurred. Not a technical reason—a human-comprehensible reason. "Because you approved payment #1234 for $50 to Recipient on Date."

**What this means for you**: Every action has a traceable origin in your decisions.

### 5.3 Every Execution Answers: Under Whose Authority

Every execution identifies who authorized it. In single-party contexts, that's you. In multi-party contexts, you see exactly who approved.

**What this means for you**: You can always trace authority back to specific humans.

### 5.4 Every Execution Answers: Under Which Caps

Every execution shows which limits applied. What was the maximum allowed? What was actually executed? How does this compare to your caps?

**What this means for you**: You can verify that caps were respected.

### 5.5 Plain Language, No Jargon

Explanations are in language you can understand. Not technical identifiers. Not system codes. Human words describing human actions.

**What this means for you**: You don't need to decode the explanation.

---

## 6. Failure and Safety Guarantees

### 6.1 Failures Default to Non-Execution

If something goes wrong—network failure, timeout, unexpected response, ambiguous state—the system does NOT proceed with execution. Failure means stop, not guess.

**What this means for you**: If something breaks, your money stays where it is.

### 6.2 No Retries Without Renewed Consent

If an execution fails, the system does not automatically retry. You will be informed of the failure and asked whether to try again. Your consent is required for each attempt.

**What this means for you**: Failed executions don't keep trying until they succeed.

### 6.3 No Silent Fallbacks

If the intended action cannot be completed, the system does not substitute a "similar" action. It does not find an alternative. It stops and asks you.

**What this means for you**: You get what you asked for, or you get asked again.

### 6.4 Uncertainty Means No Execution

If the system cannot determine whether execution succeeded, it treats the state as uncertain and does not proceed with dependent actions. You will be informed of the uncertainty.

**What this means for you**: Ambiguity doesn't cascade into more ambiguity.

## 7. What We Will Never Do (Execution Edition)

QuantumLife will NEVER:

### 7.1 Execute Without Asking

We will never move your money or create commitments without your explicit approval. Ever. Under any circumstances. Regardless of convenience.

### 7.2 Optimize Your Spending

We will never execute actions designed to "improve" your spending according to our judgment. Your spending is yours. We do not grade it, optimize it, or adjust it.

### 7.3 Enforce Your Budgets

We will never refuse to execute because you'd exceed a budget you set. Budgets are informational. If you choose to exceed them, we inform you and proceed. We do not block you from your own money.

### 7.4 Speed Up to Save Time

We will never skip safety steps, confirmation screens, or revocation windows to make execution faster. Speed is not a virtue in financial execution. Safety is.

### 7.5 Learn Your Preferences and Act

We will never use patterns in your behavior to predict and execute actions. "You usually pay this bill on the 15th" does not mean we pay it on the 15th. Prediction does not become execution.

### 7.6 Execute in Batches for Efficiency

We will never combine multiple approvals into batch execution without explicit consent for each item in the batch. Efficiency does not override consent.

### 7.7 Continue When You're Gone

We will never execute actions while you're away that you didn't explicitly schedule. Background execution is forbidden. Your absence is not consent.

### 7.8 Pressure You to Approve

We will never use urgency, fear, loss framing, or social pressure to encourage execution approvals. Approval is a calm decision, not a rushed one.
