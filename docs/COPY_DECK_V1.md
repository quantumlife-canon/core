# Copy Deck v1

## Purpose

This document contains all user-facing copy for QuantumLife. Every word must conform to the Product Language System. Copy is treated as code — it is versioned, reviewed, and tested.

---

## 1. Landing Page Copy

### Variant A — Category Definition

**Hero**: Nothing Needs You

**Sub-headline**: QuantumLife is a personal operating system that handles life administration in the background. When it's working, you don't notice.

**Category line**: Not a todo list. Not an inbox. Not an assistant. A system that handles, so you don't have to.

---

### Variant B — Problem/Solution

**Hero**: Your life runs itself

**Sub-headline**: Bills. Appointments. Renewals. The invisible weight of modern life. QuantumLife handles it in the background, surfacing only what truly needs you.

**Category line**: The first personal OS designed for silence.

---

### Variant C — Emotional

**Hero**: Feel lighter

**Sub-headline**: QuantumLife takes on the mental load of life administration. You see what needs a decision. Everything else is handled.

**Category line**: Success is measured in peace of mind, not productivity.
